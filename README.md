# whole-genome-pipeline

Whole genome pipeline using Python (3.6)

  - Still very early stage of development.
  - All variables are hard coded. Need little bit of efforts to replace them - I am too busy/lazy at the moment.
  - Need to set up according to instructions in "env_setup" to execute the pipeline end-to-end.
